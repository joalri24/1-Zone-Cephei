# One-zone Cepheid Star / Cefeida de una Zona

This is a desktop standalone application that simulates a Cepheid Star using the one-zone model approach.
Made in Windows Forms. Executables can be found on the folder "Versiones".
This software was part of my final project for the Stellar Astrophysics class in Universidad de los Andes. 

The software calculates and charts the behavior of the external shell of the start over time. The user can manipulate the initial values of the star and the number of iterations that are to be executed. The attributes charted are shell velocity, pressure and volume over time.

Theory can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EYbPTpzPIpDvU57kSfRnGMlUTxeHqjfH).
